    1 byte b
    1 float x
    1 float dx
    1 float y
    1 float dy
    1 float ang 
    1 float dang
    1 byte status (1 = engine on)

2 = keys down (from players)
    1 byte keys down. From least significant bit:
      - 1 bit throttle
      - 1 bit break
      - 1 bit turn left
      - 1 bit turn right
